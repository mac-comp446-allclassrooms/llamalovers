    <h1 id="election">Ungulate of the Year: The Candidates</h1>

    <h2>The dromedary or Arabian camel</h2>
    <img src="images/dromedary_camel.jpg">
    <p><em>(Camelus dromedarius)</em> is a large even-toed ungulate with one hump on its back. Its native range is unclear, but it was probably the Arabian Peninsula. The domesticated form occurs widely in North Africa and the Middle East; the world's only population of dromedaries exhibiting wild behaviour is an introduced feral population in Australia.</p>

    <h2 id="llama">The llama</h2>
    <img src="images/llama.jpg">
    <p><em>(Lama glama)</em> is a South American camelid, widely used as a pack and meat animal by Andean cultures since pre-hispanic times. Llamas are very social animals and like to live with other llamas as a herd. Overall, the fiber produced by a llama is very soft and is naturally lanolin free. Llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, llamas can carry about 25% to 30% of their body weight for several miles.</p>

    <h2>Alpaca</h2>
    <img src="images/alpaca.jpg">
    <p><em>(Vicugna pacos)</em> is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance. Alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes of southern Peru, northern Bolivia, Ecuador, and northern Chile at an altitude of 3,500 m (11,500 ft) to 5,000 m (16,000 ft) above sea-level, throughout the year. Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, alpacas are often bred specifically for their fiber.</p>

    <h2>The Bactrian camel</h2>

    <img src="images/bactrian_camel.jpg">
    <p><em>(Camelus bactrianus)</em> is a large even-toed ungulate native to the steppes of central Asia. It is presently restricted in the wild to remote regions of the Gobi and Taklimakan Deserts of Mongolia and Xinjiang, China. It is one of the two surviving species of camel. The Bactrian camel has two humps on its back, in contrast to the single-humped Dromedary camel.</p>
